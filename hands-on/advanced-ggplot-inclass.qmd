## Goal

The goal of today's class session is to learn how to produce customized and polished data visualizations using the `ggplot2` package. Generating basic data visualizations in ggplot can be relatively easy, but tweaking and customizing a figures to the point where it's "publication quality" can often involve quite a bit of additional work such as figuring out what key aesthetic properties to tweak, generating derived data for annotations, etc.

To provide you with experience in producing publication quality figures, you'll work with your fellow classmates with the aim of reproducing the figure shown below.

## Subplot 1

Description: A bivariate scatter plot depicted the joint distribution of 

Key tweaks:

* Uses RColorBrewer color scheme "Dark2"
* Legend labels to have latinate names and those names are italicized. Achieved using `ggtext::element_markdown()` and changing the `legend.text` parameter in `theme()`
* Legend text and symbols increased in size for readability (see `guides()` and `guide_legend()`)

## Subplot 2

Description: A distribution plot comparing the distributions of "bill ratio", a derived variable calculated as the ratio of bill width to bill length.

Key tweaks:

* Uses `ggdist:stat_dotsinterval` geom
* Species names placed in the figure itself using `ggtext::geom_richtext()`
* Y-axis lines and ticks removed

## Subplot 3

Description: Violin plots comparing the distribution of "bill ratio" between female and male penguins, faceted by species.

Key tweaks:

* Removed the `strip` names created by the faceting 
* Removed the default legend (redundant with the facet names)
* Moved species names into the body of the figure using `ggtext::geom_richtext()`

## Multi-plot layout

Key tweaks:

* Load an image file, this [penguin illustration](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png) from the palmerpenguins web site

* Use `patchwork` to define the layout of the subplots, the image, and the "shared" legend

* Save the image to high resolution PNG and PDF
